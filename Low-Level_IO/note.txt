>> open 
- three argument : 
- mode of open
    + O_RDONLY Open the file for reading only.
    + O_WRONLY Open the file for writing only.
    + O_RDWR Open the file for reading and writing.
    + O_APPEND Append to the file when writing, rather than starting at the beginning.
    + O_CREAT Create the file if it does not exist. The mode should be given as the third argument.
    + O_TRUNC Truncate the file to zero length if opened for writing.
    + O_EXCL Return error if the file is to be created and already exists.
    + O_NDELAY Do not block on open. (This will be explained later.)
